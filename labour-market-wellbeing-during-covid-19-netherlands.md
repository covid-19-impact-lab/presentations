# Key messages

- Labour market:
  - Small effects on extensive margin
  - Hours of work took deep dive, back up quickly
  - Early support programmes worked well, no rise in inequality
- Gender division
  - Women reduce hours more initially
  - Presence of children does not affect either parents' hours
  - Pre-Pandemic allocation of care tasks is reinforced
- Mental well-being
  - Strong reduction in mental health score in March
  - Back up to normal levels by May
  - Very different for parents

# Based on three papers

- Gaudecker, ... IZA DP 
- 
- No additional effect of children being present in the household on
  either parent!
- Allocation of additional childcare depends on hours of work
  pre-CoViD:
  - If both parents work full-time before pandemic: roughly equal
    shares
  - Combinations FT / PT or FT / no work: Gender care gap increases

# Data: Background

- LISS: Online Panel in the Netherlands, running since 2007
- Sibling of UAS
  - Descendant of CentERpanel
  - Joint usage via [Open Probability-Based Panel
    Alliance](https://openpanelalliance.org/)
- Roughly 5,000 households / 7,500 individuals
- Each month, respondents get ≅30 minutes of questionnaires
- Around 85% of respondents can be linked to administrative microdata
  (not today)

# Data: CoViD-19 surveys, Time Use

- CoViD-19 questionnaires
  - March 20-31 (mild lockdown), April 6-28 (mild lockdown), May
    (daycare / primary schools started reopening), June, September
  - See
    <https://liss-covid-19-questionnaires-documentation.readthedocs.io/>
  - Will mostly use hours of work
- Time use & consumption questionnaires
  - November 2019: Baseline
  - April 2020: Similar to November 2019 edition, adapted to
    lockdown situation
  - November 2020: Similar to November 2019, adapted to current
    situation

# Hours worked / worked from home

# Fixed effects regressions

- Hours of work on gender × month, controls
- Large heterogeneity
  - Non-essential FT women reduce 3 **more** hours during lockdown
    than non-essential men
  - Essential FT women reduce 1.5 hours **less** than non-essential
    men
- Rich controls on RHS, exact set does not matter:
  - month × gender × (1, part time, essential worker, age)
  - month × (age, percentage of work doable from home,
    self-employment, profession, sector)
- Add gender × month × school children at home
  - No change (precise zero or hours slightly **better** preserved
    among parents)
  - Coefficients very similar when restricting sample to 2-parent
    families

# Takeaways

- Gender division of tasks during CoViD-19: Very heterogeneous
  - Not back to the 1950s
  - Not the great equalizer
  - Pre-existing patterns re-inforced
- Western Europe: Work hours of women (relatively) well preserved
  - Consequence of highly subsidised daycare with comparably short
    hours?
  - Short school closures (≅2-3 months) very likely key
- Glimpse of hope in the long run via changed norms?
  - Home office acceptance rises for men, less hindrance on career
    path
  - No long commute on 2-3 days → available for childcare /
    emergencies
