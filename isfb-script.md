## Much tougher to control pandemic at higher levels of infections than at lower levels

- Contact tracing crucial (see Fetzer/Graeber paper)
- Capacity constraints bite quickly

## Top 1 choice is Asia / Australia / New Zealand

- Tough measures to fight pandemic at smallest sign of outbreak
- Largely back to normal life (saw pics of football game with 49k spectators in AUS?)

## German response so-so

- Always waited a tad too long
- But then reasonable measures, close to scientific advice
- Except for testing (but conflicting advice)
- So far managed to avoid shortages

## Problematic

- Populist leaders (U.K., U.S.) -- our intuition fails us with exponential growth
- Fights between different levels of gov't hierarchy (Spain, France, Italy second wave)

## What is good for economy?

- Lighter lockdowns no big deal (restaurants / culture highly visible but small numbers)
- As long as govt's have fiscal capacity, can reimburse
- Much more difficult to do if customers stay away because of infection risk
- Test, test, test
